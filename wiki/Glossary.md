# openpilot Glossary

This glossary defines common terms, acronyms, and concepts frequently encountered when working with the openpilot codebase and ecosystem.

*This glossary is intended to complement and potentially consolidate information from existing resources like `docs/glossary.toml` and `docs/concepts/glossary.md`.*

---

**A**

*   **ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control):** A driver assistance feature that automatically adjusts the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe distance from vehicles ahead. openpilot often enhances or replaces stock ACC functionality.
*   **ALC (Automated Lane Centering):** A core openpilot feature that keeps the vehicle centered in its lane.
*   **Actuators:** Components in a vehicle that take action, such as the steering motor, throttle body, or brake controller. openpilot sends commands to these actuators via the CAN bus.
*   **AGNOS:** The operating system developed by comma.ai that runs on comma hardware.

**B**

*   **CAN (Controller Area Network):** A vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other's applications without a host computer. openpilot reads and sends CAN messages to understand and control the car.
*   **Cap'n Proto:** An extremely fast data interchange format and RPC system used by `cereal` for defining and serializing messages.
*   **`CarParams` (CP):** A data structure (often a Cap'n Proto message or a Python class/dict) containing vehicle-specific parameters essential for openpilot's operation, such as steer ratio, wheelbase, control tuning values, etc.
*   **`CarState` (CS):** A `cereal` message that provides real-time status information from the vehicle, like speed, steering angle, button presses, etc.
*   **`CarControl` (CC):** A `cereal` message that contains the actuator commands (steering, throttle, brake) generated by openpilot to be sent to the car.
*   **`cereal`:** openpilot's custom messaging library built on Cap'n Proto and ZMQ, used for inter-process communication. (See [Inter-Process Communication with `cereal`](Inter-Process-Communication-with-Cereal.md))
*   **comma three/3X:** Hardware devices developed by comma.ai designed to run openpilot.
*   **`controlsd`:** The core openpilot process responsible for calculating and sending control commands (steering, acceleration, braking) to the vehicle. (See [components/controlsd.md](components/controlsd.md))

**D**

*   **DBC (Data Base CAN):** A file format that defines the structure of messages on a CAN bus, including message IDs, signal names, positions, and scaling factors. openpilot uses DBC files (from `opendbc`) to interpret and create CAN messages for different vehicles.
*   **DM (Driver Monitoring):** The system that monitors the driver's attention and engagement, typically using a driver-facing camera.
*   **`dmonitoringd`:** The openpilot process responsible for driver monitoring.
*   **DT_CTRL:** A constant representing the time step for the main control loop, typically 0.01 seconds (100Hz).
*   **DT_MDL:** A constant representing the time step for the model execution loop, typically 0.05 seconds (20Hz).

**F**

*   **Fingerprinting:** The process by which openpilot identifies the specific make, model, and year of a car by analyzing the CAN messages it observes upon startup.
*   **FW (Firmware):** Refers to the software running on ECUs (Electronic Control Units) in the car or on the Panda hardware.

**L**

*   **Lateral Control:** The aspect of openpilot's control system responsible for steering the vehicle to keep it in its lane.
*   **`locationd`:** The openpilot process responsible for sensor fusion (GPS, IMU, etc.) and determining the vehicle's precise position, orientation, and velocity.
*   **Longitudinal Control:** The aspect of openpilot's control system responsible for managing the vehicle's speed (acceleration and braking) to maintain the set cruise speed or follow a lead vehicle.
*   **`longitudinalPlan`:** A `cereal` message from `plannerd` that provides the target speed and acceleration profile for longitudinal control.

**M**

*   **`manager.py`:** The process responsible for starting, stopping, and monitoring other openpilot processes.
*   **MPC (Model Predictive Control):** An advanced control strategy used in openpilot, particularly for longitudinal control, which optimizes control inputs over a future prediction horizon.
*   **`modeld`:** The openpilot process responsible for running machine learning models (e.g., for perception, path planning) and publishing their outputs.

**O**

*   **`opendbc`:** A submodule/repository containing a collection of DBC files for various car makes and models.
*   **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange):** A format for representing machine learning models. openpilot uses ONNX for its driving and driver monitoring models.

**P**

*   **Panda:** A hardware interface developed by comma.ai that sits between the openpilot device (e.g., comma three) and the vehicle's CAN buses. It forwards messages, enforces safety rules, and can send control commands. (See `panda/` submodule).
*   **`pandad`:** The openpilot process that communicates with the Panda hardware.
*   **Parameter Store / Params:** The file-based key-value system used by openpilot to store persistent configuration, calibration, and settings. (See [Parameter Management](Parameter-Management.md))
*   **`plannerd`:** The openpilot process responsible for high-level path and behavior planning, generating `longitudinalPlan` and `lateralPlan` messages.

**S**

*   **SCons:** The build system used by openpilot to compile C++, Cython, and other code components.
*   **Service (cereal):** A named channel or topic used in `cereal` for publishing and subscribing to specific types of messages. Defined in `cereal/services.py`.
*   **SubMaster (sm):** A class in `cereal.messaging` used by processes to subscribe to and receive messages from specified services.
*   **PubMaster (pm):** A class in `cereal.messaging` used by processes to publish messages to specified services.

**U**

*   **UI (User Interface):** The graphical interface displayed on the comma device, managed by the `selfdrive/ui/ui.cc` and related processes/files.

**V**

*   **`vEgo`:** A common variable name representing the ego vehicle's speed (longitudinal velocity).

**Z**

*   **ZMQ (ZeroMQ):** A high-performance asynchronous messaging library used as the underlying transport layer for `cereal`.
